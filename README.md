# Tenzies App

Welcome to my personal project, a unique game called "Tenzies" built using React. In this game, players roll 10 dice in each round and have to pick the same number on all the dice to win. It's a simple yet challenging game that adds an element of luck and randomness to the gameplay. I have used React to build the user interface and manage the game state, and JavaScript for the game logic and the dice rolling functionality. The game also features a reset button to start a new game and a scoreboard to keep track of the wins. I hope you enjoy playing Tenzies as much as I enjoyed building it. Feel free to take a look and give me feedback.
